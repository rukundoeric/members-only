# Members Only
In this project, we implemented an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.


## Built With

- Ruby
- Rails

### Getting started

**To get this project set up on your local machine, follow these simple steps:**

- Clone this repo
- Cd into the clone folder
- run `bundle install` to install the requered gems
- then run `yarn install` to setup webpack and install all its packages
